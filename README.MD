# R(NN)-Echo
Recho is a code inspector that undestands coding styles to later detect deviations from it.
When a new person joins the team, it can be used to check if the person coding style match the one used by the team.

<h2>What kind of magic?</h2>
Recho uses an LSTM in an anomaly detection setting to detect deviations from the coding style.
It can successfully detect deviations in the C# language (probably in others too -  but too lazy to try!)
